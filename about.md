## Mtcars filtering 

This Shiny App is for filtering a visualization of Mtcars dataset that is part of datasets library within R.
The dataset explanation can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).  

 
## How to use it

The application is created for helping you to pick a car based on two main parameters:
- MPG
- HP

The backend of the application filters based on the MPG, HP and Cars list from which you can choose a car.

It allows you select cars that would be included into the filtering that helps you remove options that are no go for you as future car owner.

Make sure that you notice the the Show entries in the top or the paggination on the bottom of the table.  Otherwise you might miss some of the results.
